There is two approaches that can be used with Next.js 15 and the library next-intl

With I18n Routing: Translate texts based on prefix-bases or domainbased routes

Without i18n Routing: Translate based on a single language based on user configurations

In this tutorial we're going to implement only the "With i18n Routing" because it's so much more dynamic. If you need to implement a translate solution more static you can check the official docs from next-intl.

Routing with i18n
Step 1: Install library next-intl with the command

# Yarn 
yarn add next-intl
# NPM
npm install next-intl
Step 2: Configure next.config.ts

Your's next.config.ts have to be update from it's initial state like below

import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
}
 
export default nextConfig
to this new one, where your configuration is being passed as parameter to a withNextIntl() function

import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import createNextIntlPlugin from "next-intl/plugin";

const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {};

export default withNextIntl(nextConfig);
Step 3: Create a routing file

Into the src of your project, create a folder named i18n and inside of it create a new file named routing.ts

import { defineRouting } from "next-intl/routing";
import { createNavigation } from "next-intl/navigation";

export const routing = defineRouting({
  locales: ["en", "pt"], // Define in this line the possible languages for translation
  defaultLocale: "en", // Define in this line the default language to be shown
});

export const { Link, redirect, usePathname, useRouter } =
  createNavigation(routing);
Step 4: Setup a middleware

Now create a file named middleware.ts in the src of your project

import createMiddleware from "next-intl/middleware";
import { routing } from "./i18n/routing";

export default createMiddleware(routing);

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/", "/(pt|en)/:path*"], // At this line, define into the matcher all the availables language you have defined into routing.ts
};
Step 5: Define a central module for Server Components

Define a file named request.ts into your i18n folder. Based on next-intl docs this is needed for using the features of next-intl into Server Components.

import { getRequestConfig } from "next-intl/server";
import { routing } from "./routing";

export default getRequestConfig(async ({ requestLocale }) => {
  let locale = await requestLocale;

  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
  if (!locale || !routing.locales.includes(locale as any)) {
    locale = routing.defaultLocale;
  }

  return {
    locale,
    messages: (await import(`../../messages/${locale}.json`)).default,
  };
});
Step 6: Move all your project structure inside a [locale] directory into the src/app directory. Your project structure should follow this

├── messages
│   ├── en.json
│   └── pt.json
├── next.config.ts
└── src
    ├── i18n
    │   ├── routing.ts
    │   └── request.ts
    ├── middleware.ts
    └── app
        └── [locale]
            └──... // Here comes your subfolders into routing structure
Step. 7: Setup the translations dictionaries

Now you have to define the dictionaries for each language you have configured into your routing.ts. I suggest you to divide it into contexts based on your components name for a better organization, like the example below:

{
  "Home": {
    "title": "NextJS i18n Tutorial",
    "description": "Tutorial of how to manipulate i18n based on route path or domain with  Nextjs v15"
  },
  "Step1": {
    "title": "Step 1 Title",
    "EXPLANATION_PARAGRAPH1": "lorem ipsum"
  },
  "Step2": {
    "title": "Step 2 Title",
    "EXPLANATION_PARAGRAPH1": "lorem ipsum",
    "EXPLANATION_PARAGRAPH2": "lorem ipsum",
    "EXPLANATION_PARAGRAPH3": "lorem ipsum"
  }
}
Step. 8: Use the useTranslations hook into your's component

Now everything was ended setup you can declare into your component the useTranslations hook using the following code:

import { useTranslations } from 'next-intl'; // declare this import

export default function HomePage() {
    const t = useTranslations('Home'); // declare the hook passing into parameter a context name
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{t('title')}</h1> // Call the hook by passing as parameter the dictionary key you want
        </div>
    );
}
Conclusion

In this tutorial, we’ve successfully walked through the essential steps for implementing internationalization (i18n) in Next.js 15 using the next-intl library with i18n routing. By setting up language-specific routes and creating a centralized configuration, we’ve enabled our application to dynamically switch between languages based on route prefixes. This approach not only enhances the user experience by providing a seamless, multilingual interface but also streamlines the localization process for developers.

With the flexibility provided by next-intl, you can easily scale this setup as your application grows, adding more languages or tailoring content to specific audiences. For those looking for a simpler, static translation solution, next-intl offers alternative configurations. Remember to explore and expand your dictionaries as your project evolves. Now you’re ready to deliver a multilingual experience that resonates with global users — good luck!
